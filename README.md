# 3D Snake Game

3D Snake Game written in Unity for System Hacks which is based on 90's theme which had very simple concept games which at the time lacked technology. We took the idea of the snake game and built a 3D version of it with additional functionality in Unity since at the time the concept of 3D games was just a dream and impossible to reach with the state of technology available.
